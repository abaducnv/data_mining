automobile is just one of few unfair act and practice to which it neither admitted nor denied when it agreed to settle federal investigation on friday but the bank will pay very high price for these alleged misdeed 1 billion the highest the cfpb ha ever imposed against financial institution the cfpbs description of well fargo behavior is breathtaking the company forcibly placed duplicative or unnecessary insurance on hundred of thousand of vehicle owned by customer who had taken out car loan with the bank this not only resulted in typical charge of over 1000 to which these customer had never agreed but for at least 27000 customer the bureau wrote the additional cost of the forceplaced insurance could have contributed to default that resulted in the repossession of their vehicle in better world the federal reserve would prevent serial offender bank like well fargo from existing and the department of justice would prosecute mass car theft a crime but it is at least good that federal regulator exists to levy fine against these outrage and give restitution to wronged family the cfpb ha only been around few year but prior to the well fargo settlement it had returned about 12 billion in illgotten gain to american consumer figure that is considerably higher after it biggestever settlement the bureau is creation of the democratic party signed into law by president barack obama and designed by sen elizabeth warren dmass yet some congressional democrat are joining republican supporting legislation that consumer advocate say would strip the cfpb of the power to bring

regulation that also engage in offering or providing consumer financial product or service for such firm which include essentially every major bank the bureau would lose it authority to the extent such company is engaged in the business of insurance state insurance regulator which have much weaker record of consumer protection enforcement would replace the cfpb in january the progressive advocacy group american for financial reform sent sharply worded letter to member of congress warning that the bill strike major blow against cfpb regulatory authority over large financial service firm that would have called into question the cfpbs ability to investigate and punish the well fargo scheme to sell unnecessary insurance to it auto credit customer a month earlier 20 organization

lenderplaced auto policy state insurance regulator claimed there were purportedly no problem in that market the group wrote manchin and moore have long history of supporting bankfriendly legislation at the expense of american family and both declined to comment for this article baldwin spokesperson insisted that the bill doesnt actually do anything this legislation doe not strip or change the agency authority to enforce compliance when an insurer offer cfpbcovered product baldwin staffer said the bill simply clarifies that the cfpbs role is to enforce consumer protection law and also reaffirms existing law on statebased regulation of insurance by state insurance office and commissioner cfpb retains the oversight authority being used in it enforcement action against well fargo

of the two kind of people in the world those who embrace social medium and those who shun it she is of the group that ha never really used platform like facebook twitter instagram and snapchat of the estimated 280 million american over the age of 13 213 million are on facebook leaving the rest to call their friend one at time when they get new puppy or send postcard from vacation rather than posting photo and now a facebook founder mark zuckerberg testifies before congress for two day about the datamining operation and the house permanent select committee investigates whether cambridge analytica wa working with the kremlin shunners like podolsky are feeling vindicated i wouldnt say im feeling smug it more complicated than that say podolsky an author film producer and small business owner in los angeles facebook traded on our identity our privacy with impunity for their own gain that wa their business model to sell our very self to advertiser know that is genius it even awesome it also terrifying that it is awesome the reason nonusers give for nonusing are varied and nuanced for podolsky it about the misappropriation of the concept of friendship think initially what caught my aversion wa facebooks cooption of the word friend she say found it incrementally arrogant and intrusive to decide they could diminish the obligation and commitment of actual friendship thats where my personal antipathy started for rachel bamberger it wa about the substitution of virtual experience for real one try to find pleasure in real face time with my friend or reading book or listening to music say the high school senior dont read book online because love the smell of real book and the feel of actually turning the page in my hand you lose all the sensory part when you spend all that time staring at screen for others the core reason wa the fear of loss of privacy im even hesitant to talk to you said one office administrator in florida who nothing if not consistent declined to be quoted by name definitely wouldnt want you to identify me in an article she recall passing an oldfashioned phone booth a part of display and having to explain it purpose to her young child they asked whats it for and had to say thered be phone in there and you would close the door so you can talk she recall it used to be that phone call were presumed to be private now it blah blah blah hysterectomy blah blah blah my yeast infection blah blah blah shes tried what she insists is the facebook fad few year ago when group shed joined that met up for agility training for dog began using the site for scheduling joined for my dog and within half an hour of getting onto facebook client who had sexually harassed me wanted to friend me and right after him got request from woman who had worked with who knew to be mentally ill just felt so exposed just closed my account and a result stopped attending agility training session i did lose out on that social interaction she say because didnt want this other element michael gerstein in turn say he ha stayed off social medium because he long feared something much like the cambridge analytica news of the past few week it the wild west he say where people are grabbing all sort of information about you and you dont know what they know or how they use it he work in corporate finance in manhattan responsible for budgeting and forecasting and wa originally put off by the fact that facebook ha to be doing something like this because they have to make money but didnt understand exactly what that something is and im not comfortable with thing dont understand he ha never used twitter or snapchat he say he doe have facebook account but have never posted have replied to post but couldnt even tell you how to post the reason he even opened the account in the first place he say is because my wife wanted her profile to say she is married and it wont say that unless your spouse also ha an account his wife wa mistaken still the account exists and he ha 62 facebook friend any one of those might have answered the 2014 cambridge analytica survey that the company then used to access the information of everyone in that

technology there the idea out there that older people dont know how to use this and thats why they stay away she say but in fact she ha website for her business and spends much of her day on the computer it is not that she is incapable of understanding the new way she say but because she understands them too completely in my mind a psychotherapist the most important thing in this world is human connection she say and social medium doe foster version of that but it version that ha u relating to device rather than set of eye thats gazing at you if we fast forward what are people going to be like 100 year from now will they remember how to relate in real life at all think the implication and the ramification are enormous sherry hamby psychology professor at the university of the south

her experience few of the presumed reason actually hold true for instance while it is assumed that individual who live in appalachia do not own the latest in technology because they cant afford it her

strategy of resistance and navigation wa one of dozen about privacy at the margin included in special issue of the international journal of communication this month each of the paper wa about discrete population from aboriginal community in australia to disadvantaged urban community in india to college sophomore at big university in urban area and each concludes that the decision about technology use are driven by how user feel about the effect of particular technology on their private offline life hambys research wa conducted before the 2016 election so she doe not know how her subject feel

accounting impropriety and willful effort by autonomy to mislead shareholder revealed by whistleblower and forensic audit by accountant pricewaterhousecoopers it ha alerted regulator on both side of the atlantic mike lynch say he ha yet to hire lawyer and ha not spoken to either hp or any investigator but he ha sat down with past account of the firm he founded in an attempt to answer the accusation laid out in hp public statement hp general counsel john schultz claimed autonomy created more than 200 million in revenue over twoyear period from 2009 which would amount to 125 percent of autonomy 16 billion in revenue in their annual account for 2009 and 2010 while denying the allegation a utterly wrong lynch said there were three area where accounting rule gave scope for difference of interpretation accounting rule setter have been working on plan for decade for common global accounting rule so regulator and investor can compare company account but until that task is complete there are competing standard that can produce different result for company doing broadly the same thing the international accounting standard board iasb ha devised international financial reporting standard ifrs used in more than 100 country and the basis for autonomy account prior to hp acquisition but many u company such a hp use u generally accepted accounting principle gaap which can differ from ifrs notably in respect of software revenue recognition one of the accusation hp level against autonomy former management is that the company wa booking licensing revenue upfront before deal closed thereby inflating revenue revenue recognition for software vendor can be complicated to say the least accountant grant thornton wrote in note this is because software company often bundle product and service such a license installation training and maintenance support into single contract under accounting rule company can establish model for pricing different part of the contract so that some revenue can be taken up front and the rest over the period of the contract under ifrs this is governed by rule ia 18 under u gaap there are more stringent condition to satisfy requiring what is called vsoe or vendorspecific objective evidence it shouldnt be surprise this issue is coming up it show how looseygoosey ifrs is said lynn turner former chief accountant of the security and exchange commission who wa running the sec department that issued staff accounting bulletin 101 which set lot of the specific rule around revenue recognition lynch belief that hp might not have yet established it own vsoe model and therefore might not be recognizing revenue upfront which might result in restatement of autonomy revenue all of these deal went through autonomy auditor deloitte themselves said lynch deloitte apply the test independently of u and it is standard test and it is explicitly stated in the annual report and account autonomy would submit every single invoice to

knowledge of impropriety or misrepresentation in autonomy financial statement hardware another allegation hp ha stated in public is that autonomy mischaracterized revenue from lowmargin hardware sale a software sale autonomy always represented itself a software firm but 10 percent to 15 percent of it revenue came from moneylosing sale of lowend hardware hp said lynch said it wa not secret that autonomy sell hardware in company report for 20092010 hardware sale accounted for around 8 percent of revenue occasionally if customer wanted desktop autonomy would provide package that might include desktop for example along with the software in term of moneylosing sale lynch acknowledged that in small number of case deal were struck at slight loss in exchange for the client agreeing to market autonomy product in those case the transaction would be charged a marketing expense not direct cost of sale but overall accounted for le than 2 percent of total revenue lynch said though this move the gross margin percent or two it doesnt affect profit he added resellers another allegation made by hp is that autonomy booked some licensing deal with partner a revenue even though no customer bought product autonomy generates most of it sale revenue through deal with over 400 client including ibm and wipro who resell the software to endusers under ifrs revenue can be recognized if sale are delivered in the current period there is no right of return policy collection is probable and the fee is fixed and determinable lynch said only deal that fulfilled these criterion were booked a

              "       ' huffpost reached out to policy medium and tech expert and one congressman who questioned facebook ceo mark zuckerberg to get their reaction to zuckerbergs two day of congressional testimony rep john sarbanes dmd sarbanes asked zuckerberg to explain how facebook embeds it employee in political campaign and what kind of help the social medium giant provides to those campaign this is why he pursued those question it all go to the broader issue of facebooks ability because it is such an important commodity in the communication space to offer up benefit to client including political client including potentially sitting elected lawmaker who are the very one who are going to need to turn around step back look at arm length and decide whether there need to be some regulation of this entity so youre right back to the issue of whether special interest or powerful interest out there are in position to lean on the gear of the system in way that can get them special treatment when it come to public policy what he hope to find out im very interested to know how doe this work is an embedded facebook employee sitting next to the chief information officer or the digital tech supervisor of the campaign sitting right next to them a they run into problem getting ad approved according to the facebook requirement and so forth can the campaign person turn to that employee next to them and say can you help me out what do we do here and did that result in this real imbalance huge imbalance in the number of facebook ad placed for the trump campaign on the facebook platform compared with the clinton campaign that can obviously tie back to how much each campaign wa willing to purchase on the platform but the approval process for ad can take some turnaround time and if you have an embedded employee sitting there next to you you might be able to get that fasttracked we dont know but these are some of the question that need to be asked whether he thought zuckerbergs response wa adequate not really mean he didnt really have much time to do it because we were limited to four minute in part because facebook negotiated that with the committee so if wed have more time each of u to pose our question he would have had more time to answer them but obviously some of the thing wa asking for were not thing that could be provided in the moment but are thing were going to follow up on and try to get in the coming day and his concern about congress response im very concerned that once the kind of theater of the last two day is behind u and other event and certainly there other event these day kind of push the zuckerberg hearing and these latest breach at facebook off the front page that all of these assurance from zuckerberg about being willing to embrace appropriate regulation and thing of that nature will suddenly evaporate he wa quite careful a he endorsed the honest ad act or endorsed certain regulation in term of their privacy practice it always obviously we want to see the detail but in concept we agree with that well to me thats sort of code for future resistance filip struhárik editor at the slovakian news outlet denník at the end of 2017 facebook tested splitting user news feed in two post from family and friend v everything else in six country including slovakia the test wa disaster that radically disrupted entire news ecosystem in those country it also demonstrated the extreme power facebook ha over smaller nation that dont have a much history with free press and democratic election a the u struhárik helped bring attention to how facebooks experiment affected his organization he emailed his reaction to zuckerbergs testimony mark zuckerberg said lot during last week and we are monitoring his plan but it remains unclear what will be launched just in u and what will be ready globally too let look on one particular topic promised greater politicalads transparency it raise lot of question is it something we can expect in small country too this is an important question because we will have two election regional and presidential in slovakia during next 12 month will slovak advertiser need to confirm their identity and location if they want to run political ad we still dont know how will facebook find out what is political ad and what is not if the new rule will apply just to official political campaign the situation doe not improve because there are many other bad actor the new rule would have to apply for all who want to run any kind of political ad but even after all already ha been said we dont know important detail so we are waiting for specification matt stoller fellow at the open market institute stoller and the open market institute advocate for stronger antitrust enforcement against corporation including digital platform like facebook and google this is his reaction to zuckerbergs testimony i take two thing from these hearing first this wa the big bang of silicon valley politics with host of important issue coming to light that will be debated and worked through for year already the consequence are rolling through to take one example facebook rolled out new data targeting policy to advertiser a zuckerberg wa testifying to take another federal trade commission nominee rebecca kelly slaughter had nominating hearing at the very same time a zuckerbergs appearance before the house she will soon be one of five new nominee at the commission that regulates facebook she took multiple question from republican and democratic senator on the facebook data and monopoly problem which is signal that the senate expects action from the ftc second the problem with facebook is it market power the problem in nutshell is that it a if facebook owns the phone network but listens to what everyone say and manipulates them based on what it hears to serve facebooks interest facebook ha locked in two billion user into it essential communication service along with million of content producer it us this position to engage in surveillance and manipulation of the flow of information among these people and institution it then sell the ability to manipulate these people to advertiser and ha built host of tool to allow those advertiser to engage in discrimination on who see their ad fundamentally most of the harmful symptom that emerge from facebook from it rampant privacy violation to fomenting ethnic hatred and genocide to content discrimination are function of it misuse of it market power over an essential communication service there are number of way to make facebook safe for democracy but fundamentally we must break the company power by splitting off it various social network instagram whatsapp facebook ending it ability to discriminate and spy on it user and forcing competition into the market u representative kathy castor dfla summed up the two day of testimony best with her statement on the problem with facebook she said in the end american do not like to be manipulated laura moy deputy director at georgetown law center on privacy technology moy is an expert on technology issue ranging from digital privacy to government surveillance copyright and net neutrality she said this stood out to her in zuckerbergs testimony it inevitable that facebook will be harnessed for ill purpose such a to advance hate speech false news or deceptive political ad thats because the platform is designed to make it easy and cheap for anyone to target their message whatever it is to user who are likely to engage with that message in other word it an efficient tool for evil a well a for good and zuckerbergs answer on this issue just werent good enough when asked about hate speech on facebook time and time again mark zuckerberg responded that the platform is hoping to use artificial intelligence to automatically identify problematic content and flag it for removal but also repeatedly acknowledged that hateful language is nuanced and artificial intelligence isnt yet able to reliably do that so they have to hire human to review content in fact lot of expert believe that artificial intelligence will never be good enough to reliably identify problematic content what if thats the case how will facebook sufficiently prevent it platform from being captured by those who would use it to harm others these hearing didnt sufficiently answer that question alex howard deputy director of the sunlight foundation howard is former tech reporter including at huffpost who now help run the protransparency sunlight foundation the nonprofit is pushing the honest ad act which would require digital platform to provide greater transparency around political ad this is howard takeaway from zuckerbergs testimony first id note that while facebook ha endorsed our bill zuckerbergs claim that they are implementing it is questionable the definition of electioneering should be expanded to digital platform and level playing field for transparency and accountability should be mandated selfregulation is not enough facebook could have raised the bar on transparency many year ago instead of lobbying against legislation or regulation second the breadth of question posed showed the many different way that the rise power and influence of facebook implicates different aspect of american society but the short time that member of congress had to pose them and the lack of understanding that senator demonstrated did not deliver effective oversight nor with notable exception significantly improve public understanding lawmaker need to grasp the complex technology and policy issue presented by entity like facebook to effectively enact the change in law and institution that president jefferson once said must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind a we pointed out the public ha now been reminded of how well many u senator understand facebook privacy and technology or not if we want better policy and strong oversight we need to make congress smarter restoring the office of technology assessment could help but it not sufficient abysmal trust in congress requires the institution to create better hearing process that ensures informed question and critically followup question are posed to industrial and postindustrial titan called to account for how theyre protecting consumer and democracy itself the apparent lack of coordination or followup between the senate and house hearing or to the question of other member failed the public finally the problem that exist with facebook existed before these hearing and will persist when they are done zuckerberg repeatedly said that he open to regulation but wa rarely held to account on exactly what that should mean or when deferring instead to follow up with staff or work with congress the devil is always in the detail unless congress take more time to understand and then to craft careful remedy the emerging challenge for open government that facebook is implicated in from automated activity to algorithmic transparency to public speech on private platform to data ethic and protection to antitrust concern to artificial intelligence will most likely be obscured by more sound and fury emanating from washington that ultimately signifies nothing',\n",

ability to be stable in the air ive been told this is because the drone tech had been designed by the military and ha been seeping into design for the public use but stability is also what make the

this distinction had consequence online which lost it hyphen sometime before aol launched now refers to our connection to the internet and it million of active website our phone are almost always connected to the internet but we tend to consider ourselves online when we are actively engaging on website usually some kind of social medium platform the problem of facebook the most popular such platform in the u is in part problem of metaphor this much wa made clear during facebook ceo mark zuckerbergs hearing on the hill earlier this week lawmaker seemed to operate from very different conception of the social medium giant is facebook publisher wondered sen dan sullivan ralaska is facebook selfregulated superstructure for political discourse mused rep john sarbanes dmd if buy ford and it doesnt work well and dont like it can buy chevy said sen lindsey graham rsc in line of inquiry that went to the heart of the facebook question if im upset with facebook whats the equivalent product that can go sign up for last fall new york magazine max read listed various proposed comparison for facebook that hed come across state the eu the catholic church star trek united federation of planet more metaphor have bloomed in the aftermath of the cambridge analytica scandal facebook is like record company facebook is like fashion designer how can we begin to work on the question of what to do with facebook if we cant even agree on what facebook look like but perhaps the answer is a plain a the ground beneath facebooks sixth u data center which is currently under construction just outside omaha the center will open in 2023 exactly 150 year after the transcontinental railroad wa completed nearby maybe history ha handed u the right metaphor facebook is like the railroad in sense it hardly metaphor at all the internet and the railroad share the same physical space a ingrid burrington explained in an article for the atlantic in 2015 and david bank explored in scholarly journal article published the same year railroad rightofways have been used by every communication medium from telegraph wire to telephone line to fiber optic cable now digital platform corporation build their data center on these same line the late sen ted stevens wa right the internet is best thought of a series of tube not big truck just like the railroad before them platform company like facebook and google are piece of infrastructure albeit new type of infrastructure they connect people and transform society politics the nature of time and space itself and like the railroad and phone company before them they can be regulated or broken up whether they provide physical service or not this is important to acknowledge now a discussion about regulation move forward in washington following the revelation about cambridge analytica political consulting firm that harvested data from approximately 87 million facebook user facebook like google like amazon is thing or more precisely concatenation of thing these digital platform are not unearthly beast that exist apart from the real world they are realworld entity that posse corporeal form what their owner do with them and what their user do on them are real action that have real consequence just look at the past four year if you have any doubt notion that the internet is separate from real life have existed since the dawn of the web while comedian like dave chappelle mine this sentiment for joke the real beneficiary of this idea are the corporate executive who run the giant online platform currently eluding regulation if people believe that online life is distinct from what we now call real life that digital capitalism is somehow le real than the industrial capitalism on which it is quite literally founded then the impression will settle in that online company cant be regulated in the way offline company are regulated how can you write an agency rule about phantom how can you pas bill about cloud yet it quite clear that what happens online matter in offline life nearly 80 percent of american have facebook account political campaign are spending an increasing amount on digital advertising social movement including neonazis are organized on digital platform those platform have also become the best distribution tool for disinformation and propaganda a they favor individual emotional expression over reasoned discussion people have funeral for their online friend in massive multiplayer online game universe and of course the president of the united state occasionally threatens nuclear holocaust on twitter much of this activity however doesnt need to be regulated american can still vote out their president in the next election if they dont like his rage tweet about cable news story congress doesnt need to regulate anyones speech but congress could regulate the business side of the digital platform economy or force the platform giant to shrink to size at which no individual platform could alter society with the tweak of an algorithm thats being debated in policy circle right now and could soon be debated by congressional lawmaker therein lie the value of the railroad metaphor it zero in on the thingness of facebook sidestepping the free speech issue that so consumed many of the politician questioning zuckerberg in the capital this week congress can intervene for the same reason it intervened to regulate the railroad more than century ago power over infrastructure is political power railroad were the engine of 19thcentury industrial capitalism and a they became economic monopoly their market power translated into political power controlling the line that people and business rode on railroad could pick winner and loser by setting rate to benefit friend or cripple individual business john rockefeller standard oil monopoly colluded with the railroad to privilege his product over others railroad company worked to take over the political apparatus of state government and the national government by handing out free rail pass to their preferred political party installing railroad ally in office shortchanging state by evading tax and of course directly trading stock gift and cash for public good the concentrated private political influence of monopoly violated the longstanding american democratic spirit of one manone vote a corporation built nationwide network of infrastructure that held power over government monopoly mattered even more this is what the muckraking journalist henry lloyd wrote in 1881 when he argued that the railroad problem may indicate whether the american democracy like all the democratic experiment which have preceded it is to become extinct because the people had not wit enough or virtue enough to make the common good supreme that railroad problem wa that the railroad themselves were captive to an even bigger monster standard oil which used it massive market position to crush competitor by forcing the railroad to raise rate on other oil producer this then altered the economic and political life of state subject to standard oil decision congress began to take action against the railroad problem in 1890 when it enacted the landmark sherman antitrust act the law author sen john sherman rohio decried the power of monopolistic railroad on the floor of congress if we will not endure king a political power he said we should not endure king over the production transportation and sale of any of the necessary of life it wa clear to sherman that economic power wa political power his law wa later used to break up standard oil under the administration of president teddy roosevelt today digital platform behemoth like facebook and google are the major private designer of american life they make decision that affect the flow of information and pick political winner and loser with little democratic input news organization find themselves at the whim of algorithm determined by digital platform the campaign of future lawmaker who would oversee digital platform are dependent upon them to reach voter and meanwhile those platform spend ten of million of dollar on lobbying and campaign contribution to influence politics to their benefit once again this is market power translating to political power some lawmaker see this clearly a evidenced by their questioning of zuckerberg do you think you have moral responsibility to run platform that protects our democracy rep anna eshoo dcalif asked rep bill flores rtexas stated outright that facebook operates a monopoly just like standard oil and ma bell the nickname for the telephone giant that began a bell telephone and ended a att those corporation either colluded with and abused infrastructure monopoly to their benefit standard oil or were infrastructure monopoly themselves ma bell these company were started by entrepreneur and their company grew and eventually became detached from everyday american flores said and then what happens is policymakers had to step in and reestablish the balance between those folk and everyday american the congressman then veered into aggrieved irrelevancy about constituent whose conservative posting were supposedly being banned or stopped but for moment flores had been saying something useful and insightful he wa talking straightforwardly about facebook a thing thing with power that needed to be

              "       ' by delece smithbarrow the hechinger report washington bill proposed by republican in the house of representative could change the collegefinancing system dramatically moving billion of dollar out of financial aid program if hr 4508 becomes law college affordability would go from bad to worse say many higher education expert and student from lowincome background would suffer most according to an analysis by the nonpartisan congressional budget office  the net loss of fund to student over the next 10 year would be almost 15 billion if the bill is enacted a written other analyst say that figure would be even higher the bill known a the promoting real opportunity success and prosperity through education reform prosper act would also make more money and regulatory flexibility available to forprofit college many of which have been cited for high cost low graduation rate and history of taking advantage of lowincome student and military veteran if enacted it would decimate the loan repayment safety net for lowincome borrower said ben miller senior director for postsecondary education at the center for american progress leftleaning think tank it would expose student to unscrupulous actor especially in the forprofit space and it would do nothing to actually address the real problem we have around completion and equity the higher education act first passed in 1965 and revised perodically regulates how the federal government financially assist postsecondary institution and student it governs how federal student loan are distributed who is eligible for federal financial aid how loan must be repaid and which institution can receive federal money the prosper bill wa moved out of committee by house republican in december the senate is holding hearing to develop it own version with the national student debt hovering around 13 trillion lawmaker parent and student have been cry out for fix to the higher education lending system but many see the new bill proposed fix a harmful to those who most need the boost toward the middle class that come with college education for some it would make college le affordable altogether for others it would add to the debt burden they would carry after college to meet it stated goal of simplifying the many federal grant and loan program the house bill proposes streamlining application process which could help student and their family but also eliminating several of those program among the proposed cut are grant program including teacher education assistance grant for those who agree to teach after college for four year in public school serving lowincome family and federal supplemental educational opportunity grant additional grant money for qualified undergraduate student from the lowest income level the bill would also eliminate some loan program including key loan program for graduate student and some beneficial repayment option these include the option for some lowincome student to extend their repayment plan without extra interest and program that forgives loan after 10 year of repayment for those working in government or nonprofit publicservice job forprofit institution conversely would benefit from the proposed bill because it would eliminate the 9010 rule which currently prevents these institution from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenue through federal financial aid the rule push school to create program that enable student to be successful after graduation because some revenie is coming directly from student or employer before the 9010 rule wa instituted forprofitcolleges often enrolled lowincome student who had little prospect of earning degree obtained those student federal grant and loan money and suffered no consequence when the student dropped out or received substandard education a forprofit college could be hundred percent federally funded if the prosper act becomes law miller said the bill would also narrow the eligibility requirement for deferment of loan and require those in certain type of payment plan to pay more than previously expected for example the percent of whats defined a discretionary income that borrower must pay under an incomedriven repayment plan would increase from 10 to 15 percent and the bill would require even fulltime student from lowincome background to pay interest on their federal loan while they are pursuing their degree currently student are not responsible for any interest while they are in school undergrad student with low expected family contribution should not have to accrue interest while in school said jean mcdonald rash chair of the higher education loan coalition group of financial aid professional who work to improve federal loan program she said the group ha many concern about the bill in it current form for example a noted the new bill proposes ending the public service loan forgiveness program which benefit student who go into nonprofit field or government work and are not likely to earn large income we think thats very important to attract student into those kind of field of study said mcdonald rash who also director of financial aid at rutgers university some believe that with fewer option from the government to pay for school student and educator would have to think more carefully about how to finance the cost of degree currently school dont have an incentive to lower their price because student can use government aid to foot the bill said mary clare amselem an education policy analyst at the heritage foundation rightleaning think tank overwhelming economic evidence is suggesting that heavily subsidizing federal student loan ha led to college tuition increase amselem said school know that pretty much regardless of what they charge student are going to be able to find the loan from the federal government amselem also belief the new bill would push student to borrow from private lender which she say is good thing the federal government control 90 percent of the student loan market so theyve virtually crowded out private lender she said think if we had more option for student we would have very robust very competitive market that would offer really great option for student rep virginia foxx rnc chairwoman of the house committee on education and the workforce introduced the new bill in december it wa voted out of committee on straight partisan line and sent for debate in the full house our proposal offer the same deal for everyone regardless of occupation and put downward market pressure on institution to keep cost down rep foxx said in an emailed statement additionally the prosper act put additional funding behind the timetested cornerstone of financial aid for lowincome student the pell grant pell grant are awarded to student most in need to qualify family income must usually be below 50000 year the maximum grant for the 201819 school year is 5920 under the proposed new bill pell recipient would receive an additional 300 if theyre taking at least 15 academic credit per semester provision designed to encourage people to finish college a quickly a possible the education trust and 34 other organization including the naacp and the national association for college admission counseling wrote letter to several member of congress in which they said the proposed act exacerbates the increasing burden of student debt and continued inequity in higher education access and outcome it would make higher education le affordable saddle student with greater debt and push more student into loan default while bill this vast nearly 600 page ha number of pro and con many say it not an even split there couple thing here and there that arent bad for lowincome student miller said but they are far outweighed by the litany of item that would hurt them sen lamar alexander rtenn chairman of the senate committee on health education labor and pension ha said he hope to see bipartisan version by

              "       ' if pope francis prayer are answered humanity will devote more of it collective effort toward cleaning up our planet instead of polluting it how and where he think technological progress should play role in those effort is more complicated question president barack obama officially welcomed the pope to washington dc on wednesday at the white house francis began his remark by applauding the united state history of immigration he went on to say that climate change wa an issue that must be addressed now mr president find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution the pope said a obama looked on he continued accepting the urgency it seems clear to me also that climate change is problem which can no longer be left to future generation when it come to the care of our common home we are living at critical moment of history we still have time to make the change needed to bring about sustainable and integral development for we know that thing can change laudato si 13 such change demand on our part serious and responsible recognition not only of the kind of world we may be leaving to our child but also to the million of people living under system which ha overlooked them video of the pope full remark is embedded below the pope recent focus on climate change ha not been uncontroversial in the u where the partisan divide over global warming remains a wide a ever despite the overwhelming scientific consensus on the matter according to the pew research center 68 percent of american believe global warming is occurring but only 22 percent of republican say that it because of human activity something that nearly all of the world scientist agree to be the case the hottest summer on record ha done little to shift those view much le galvanize the republicancontrolled congress to take action it seems unlikely that the pope address to the u legislature on thursday will alter the trajectory of that debate based on generous reading of the encyclical that francis wrote earlier this year it seems like he would probably endorse the white house use of open climate data in the hope of increasing the resilience of the coastal city where majority of humanity will live in future decade and enabling governor and mayor to protect hundred of million of people after all in june letter to the catholic church the pope laid out moral case for fighting climate change grounded in the need to protect the poor from pollution and environmental degradation in that letter the pope embraced and supported the development of clean technology including solar energy to replace fossil fuel but even a he heralded technology a possible solution he decried not only the role that industrialization ha played in pollution but also modern mindset that exalts the use of technology to manipulate the natural world it can be said that many problem of today world stem from the tendency at time unconscious to make the method and aim of science and technology an epistemological paradigm which shape the life of individual and the working of society he wrote given the catholic church history with practitioner of the scientific method we might be inclined to take that with grain of salt but in fairness the church ha moved away from being an enemy of science in recent century pope francis himself appears to have something of lovehate relationship with technology the 78yearold pontiff who hold degree in chemistry ha supported the application of technology in various area including genetic modification in agriculture and ha called the internet gift from god he also urged young people not to waste time online or on smartphones which almost all of u do the man often described a the most influential world leader on twitter us social medium to communicate with the public a pontifex albeit not personally he ha confessed to being disaster with machine himself the pope ha also urged family to employ technology thoughtfully using screen sense a well a common sense when it come to incorporating device into our life by growing daily in our awareness of the vital importance of encountering others these new possibility we will employ technology wisely rather than letting ourselves be dominated by it he wrote in january the pope called attention in his climate change encyclical to the limit of taking an explicitly technocratic approach to complex social economic and environmental issue ecological culture cannot be reduced to series of urgent and partial response to the immediate problem of pollution environmental decay and the depletion of natural resource he wrote there need to be distinctive way of looking at thing way of thinking policy an educational programme lifestyle and spirituality which together generate resistance to the assault of the technocratic paradigm in his encyclical pope francis expressed concern about the effect of technology on our capacity to make decision and find space for creativity more subtly he wrote about the need to use technology in moral and ethical way one that make change possible without abandoning our ideal of freedom and justice but he also acknowledged that in many way technology ha improved life in way that would have once seemed impossible we are the beneficiary of two century of enormous wave of change steam engine railway the telegraph electricity automobile aeroplane chemical industry modern medicine information technology and more recently the digital revolution robotics biotechnology and nanotechnology the pope wrote it is right to rejoice in these advance and to be excited by the immense possibility which they continue to open up before u for science and technology are wonderful product of godgiven human creativity whether or not you agree with his view on technology and not everyone doe the pope focus on applying tech for public good and his habit of calling attention to the ethical question that disruptive technology can pose to society are bringing more sunlight to issue that deserve it i think thats valuable public service and it one reason among many that welcomed pope francis to washington on wednesday here hoping that his presence brings about more connection not more controversy',\n",
              "       ' it wa privilege and an honor for me to have the opportunity to interview john hagel who brings 30 year of experience of working at the intersection of business strategy and technology a management consultant author speaker and entrepreneur hagel is the cochairman of deloittes center for the edge where he is helping to identify emerging business opportunity and persuade ceo to put them on their agenda hagel frequently blog about business and technology strategy john hagel deloitte deloittes center for the edge considers the digital technology infrastructure to be one of the core force which is getting exponentially better every year but hagel say there is delicious paradox being that the very same technology that bring awesome opportunity and new possibility at same time bring mounting performance pressure accelerating change and growing uncertainty he call this the dark side of technology and it ha real implication for business that have been built around the notion of predictability standardization and tight integration to remove inefficiency the effect of the dark side are showing up in research number the center for the edge ha documented that for all public company in the u since 1965 the return on asset ha collapsed by 75 additionally there is the declining age of the sp 500 which ha gone from 61 year in 1960 to just 16 year today hagel say the problem and opportunity is that both the digital technology component computing storage and bandwidth a well a the infrastructure are not stabilizing which lead to company that are running faster and faster yet falling farther and farther behind according to hagel we are going into period where there is going to be no stability period of punctuated disruption coming at faster and faster rate business will have to adopt different set of practice and rethink at the most basic level the institution they have built to figure out how to not only survive but thrive in world where exponential technology will continue to drive uncertainty rapid change and instability in his latest book the power of pull hagel capture the essence of the change going on in today business landscape here he offer his advice the bright spot on how company can survive and even thrive in this new kind of world 7 way for individual and institution to thrive in these disruptive time 1 practice the power of pull according to hagel we are in the transition of going from world of push to world of pull it is harder to predict and forecast in an uncertain world and those who master the power of pull will survive say hagel who offer the following three level of pull for drawing out resource where and when you need them in scalable way so you can operate in world of increasing uncertainty these 3 level together come into play in powerful way in this new world and create opportunity small move smartly made can set very big thing in motion if you have scalable pull platform say hagel 2 focus on the long and very short term the paradox of success is that the more successful we are the more we come to rely on what brought u success and not even question it a uncertain a the world is executive need to fight the natural tendency in time of mounting pressure to shorten time horizon and instead take an outsidein perspective and engage in longer term thinking of where the world is headed hagel advises company to look ahead and on 1015 year time frame develop highlevel view of what their market or industry might look like and what the implication are for their company without doing this company get easily distracted by whats going on in the short term and risk spreading their resource too quickly on too many thing because they are in reactive mode next company need to flip it around and focus on the next 612 month not the typical next 15 year and ask what are the 2 or 3 activity that will have the greatest potential to accelerate movement based on the larger goal 3 move to model of scalable learning not only is scalable learning different rational and focus for an institution it is fundamentally opposed to the scalable efficiency model that is the predominant model for large company today if you are operating in an environment where predictability and low risk are the essence of success this is no space to innovate and without that you are not going to learn efficiency doe still matter so the question becomes how to achieve it in an increasing volatile and uncertain world hagel belief the way to get the highest level of efficiency is through scalable learning the idea behind the scalable learning model is that in rapidly changing world the faster everyone can learn at scale the better we will be company need to focus on broader ecosystem and connecting mobilizing and learning from third party rather than trying to do it all themselves one of hagels favorite quote is by bill joy one of the founder of sun microsystems no matter how many smart people you have in your organization just remember there are lot more smart people outside your organization hagel say you will never scale unless you can find way to connect with outside organization and create relationship where you are all learning faster than you could on your own 4 tap into the power of corporate narrative hagel draw distinction between story and narrative the later which he feel are powerful and will become very important to the pull thesis in term of engaging at an emotional level the essence of most story is that they are selfcontained they are about me the story teller or about those people not about you the listener narrative on the other hand is openended there is no resolution yet the resolution hinge on you and the choice you make will determine the outcome million of people have given their life for narrative how many people have given their life over story hagel asks 5 scale at the edge since politics can get in the way of transforming the enterprise hagel say the best way to drive change is not by trying to transform the core but going out to an edge that ha the potential to scale and ultimately become new core of the business doing this allows change agent to demonstrate the different approach to business that are going to be necessary on that edge and overtime pull more and more people and resource from the core to the edge to the point where the edge becomes new core hagel call this the methodology of scaling edge 6 ask the right question hagel say that one of the key change in leadership in rapidly changing world is that power come le from the answer you have and more from the question you ask in this new world the powerful leader are those who have the right question and help to focus people on the question that are most important this interesting reframing of what leadership is all about ha to do with the kind of network you build the old world hubandspoke network where everyone wa connected to the leader and the goal wa to get a many follower a you could is being replaced with the building of mesh network where leader are helping to create platform and environment where people can connect with each other around the question they are framing this help to find the right answer and move the ball forward we need to stop settling for the perfect answer to the wrong question 7 accept vulnerability a the path to earning trust in this new world trust is more essential to achieving goal individual and company with willingness to express vulnerability by admitting they dont always have the answer will build trust this is the polar opposite of the notion of building personal brand where we present all of our strength and accomplishment in the most compelling way and hide any weakness at the cost of undermining the brand being authentic will become increasingly important to participating in knowledge flow where key issue in the interest of learning faster is acquiring tacit knowledge hagel explains that tacit knowledge is the most valuable form of knowledge but the most difficult to share it is the knowledge in our head that come from new experience we often have trouble articulating this type of knowledge and it doe not flow easily which make it only accessible in the context of trustbased relationship if trust you will make an effort to try to frame the tacit knowledge have say hagel pulling this type of essential knowledge and learning place an increased importance on trustbased relationship at the end of the day the only sustainable pull is around trust based relationship say hagel it is the only way to amplify effort so that small move really do achieve amazing thing you can watch the full interview with john hagel here please join me and michael krigsman every friday at 3pm est a we host
